# Description:
BasketCoin - Meticulously crafted basket of cryptocurrencies
which are utilized in numerous trusted Staking & DeFi platforms
to strengthen deflation process along with the ‚buy-back & burn’.

BasketCoin combined several key elements that together make it so unique.
They include:

1. Diversified basket of cryptocurrencies,
2. Deflationary feature,
3. Buyback and Burn process,
4. Possibility of Staking,

&nbsp;

1. A fee of 2,5% of the value of each transaction will be taken from the
   transfer - 1% burned out, the other 1% goes to the staking/reward
   redistribution pool which indeed speeds up the process of reducing supply,
remaining 0,5% goes to Liquidity pool.
   Smart Contract itself assumes that a total of 90% of all BSKT will be burned
   -> supply will decrease from 21,000,000 to 2,100,000.

&nbsp;

2. The BSKT token is secured with a basket of several cryptocurrencies that cover
   its value. The security so adopted is intended to ensure a constant and
   stable increase in the value of tokens. Thanks to the correct match of coins
   in our basket, its value is less susceptible to fluctuations appearing in the
   cryptocurrency market. The Basket currently includes:

- Bitcoin (BTC),
- Ethereum (ETH),
- Polkadot (DOT),
- Smarkey (SKEY),
- YfDAI.finance (YF-DAI),
- USD Coin (USDC),
- Basketcoin (BSKT)
- CCfound 
- Synapse Network (SNP)
- Ari10.

&nbsp;

3. All listed cryptocurrencies that make up the BSKT basket will be used to
   generate additional profits on platforms such as:

- Crypto.com (profits of 3%-12% a.p.),
- YF-DAI (profits up to 72% APR),
- Swissborg (profits up to 20% a.p.),
- and other decentralised profit-generating platforms in DeFi format.

  Revenues from these platforms will be used in the repurchase process for the
  redemption and burning of BSKT tokens, contributing to a significant reduction
  in supply on the secondary market. 90% of the above profits will be used for
  repurchase and burnout, while the remaining 10% will be used for ongoing and
  necessary expenses related.
